From Wikipedia, the (free) encyclopedia. 

A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is
usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of several
sentences. There are usually between three and eight sentences. 
Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by
missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to 
see when one paragraph ends and another begins.

In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain
a topic sentence . This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader
what the paragraph will be about. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs
that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central 
idea of the essay.

Paragraphs may signal when the writer changes topics. Each paragraph may
have a number of sentences, depending on the topic.
